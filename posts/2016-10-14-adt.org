title: Asymptotic Decision Theory
---

Lately I've been working on writing up some decision theory stuff I did with some of the other MIRI folk.
The line of research was kickstarted by Jessica Taylor, and I spent a lot of time with Sam Eisenstat and Tsvi Benson-Tilsen working on it over the following month.

This writeup is currently incomplete! You can find the unfinished version [[../../files/adt.pdf][here]].
I'll be updating it soon, at which point I'll update this post and replace the file, but I figured I should push some of it since writing was already starting to drag on too long.
TODOs:
- Clean up + fill in details of optimality proof for `sadt`
- Write up the algorithm for learning systems of counterfactuals and its corresponding proof of optimality
- Write open problems section
- Figure out what else belongs on this list
