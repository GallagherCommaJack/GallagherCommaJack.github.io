title: Why Programmers Should Exercise
---

I was told that this article should be retitled, and I should make the target audience a bit more explicit.&nbsp; So I did.<br />
<br />
IF reader.alreadyExercises()<br />
&nbsp; THEN GOTO 5<br />
ELSE GOTO 10<br />

You can skip to the part where you get 
happy signals from someone reinforcing your beliefs and you share this 
on your Facebook/Twitter/other networking site.&nbsp; You probably won't find
 much new in this article, though feel free to read on.<br />

Now that that's dealt with, I'll get to the meat of this post, namely, 
why you should want to be in shape, whether or not your occupation / 
hobbies are physically involved.<br />
<br />
First, I'll lay out some of the research around this:<br />
1) Fitness (especially aerobic exercise) substantially lowers the risk of <a href="http://www.udel.edu/PT/PT%20Clinical%20Services/journalclub/noajc/08_09/Nov08/Physical%20Activity%20and%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease.pdf">Alzheimer's, dementia</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/p0000391/P0000391.asp">heart disease</a>.&nbsp;
 You can expect serious longevity increases just from those, though 
there are other things it helps with (e.g. likelihood of dying from 
infectious disease, ability to handle chemotherapy).<br />
<br />
2) <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Ebachlab/LabSite/Publications.html/kramer2005.pdf">Study</a> after <a href="http://fitnessforlife.org/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/7336.pdf">study</a> after <a href="http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/kramer.pdf">study</a> suggests that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748863/">exercise improves all sorts of cognitive processes</a>.&nbsp; Your code will almost definitely be improved, either in elegance or number of problems solved / time.&nbsp; Just because your job doesn't directly involve physical activity doesn't mean it's not helpful.<br />
<br />
To inject some anecdotal evidence, I used to never exercise.&nbsp; I made all
 sorts of excuses.&nbsp; "Oh, that's all well and good, but I don't have 
time!"&nbsp; "I'm in good enough shape &lt;runs around the block /&gt; 
&lt;hyperventilating&gt; see? &lt;/hyperventilating&gt;."&nbsp; "I can't 
afford to be tired."&nbsp; <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ju/rationalization/">Rationalization</a>
 is probably the most unfortunately-rooted word in the English language,
 and most reasons not to exercise fall into that bucket.&nbsp; I've noticed a
 few major benefits that I was quasi-deliberately underaccounting for:<br />
<br />
1) Time - my level of physical activity seems to have a strong causal 
link to clarity and speed of cognition.&nbsp; I tend to get the same amount 
of (or even more) work done as I was previously, but in time_awake - 
time_exercising instead of time_awake.<br />
<br />
2) Energy - exercising has, oddly enough, left me feeling less tired, 
not more.&nbsp; There is a relatively established link between physical 
activity and awakeness/energy/whatever-you-wish-to-call-it.&nbsp; Finding 
relevant papers is left as an exercise for the reader.<br />
<br />
Now, to directly address some common rebuttals:<br />
Exercise is boring! - I thought that too.&nbsp; If you're finding it boring, 
you're doing the wrong kind of exercise.&nbsp; Running on a treadmill not 
working for you?&nbsp; Run while watching TV, or run outside so you have 
things to look at.&nbsp; Road biking got you down?&nbsp; Get a mountain bike.&nbsp; 
Most worries about boring exercise can be solved by <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hu/the_third_alternative/">sitting and actually thinking about third alternatives for 5 whole minutes</a>.&nbsp;
 I started to get into shape with a combination of rock climbing and 
miming.&nbsp; I'd be willing to bet neither of those were in your first 
two options.&nbsp; THINK OF A THIRD ALTERNATIVE.<br />
<br />
Exercise is hard! - Yes.&nbsp; Yes it is.&nbsp; Sorry, but <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/">downsides exist to policies in complex systems</a>.&nbsp;
 I tend to get a positive feeling of accomplishment from doing difficult
 things, but your mileage may vary.&nbsp; The benefits are still probably 
going to outweigh the cost of some willpower though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other things worth noting:<br />
There's already some pretty good material on <a href="http://piratepad.net/optimalexercise">optimal exercise</a> out there, if you're concerned with getting the most bang for your metaphorical buck.<br />
<br />
As with any health-related-lifestyle-changes, your mileage may vary.&nbsp; 
That's not an excuse to give up after one day.&nbsp; If the "this is hard" 
part goes for months, something's probably up, but don't reach that 
conclusion much earlier.<br />
<br />
Another important thing to pay attention to is diet.&nbsp; Not dieting, 
diet.&nbsp; Exercise without eating healthy is like a high IQ without any 
conscientiousness.&nbsp; It's worth something, but you won't get much done.&nbsp; 
Finding a diet that works for you and sticking to it probably deserves 
its own post, but I'll try to summarize a bit here:<br />
Paleo and its variants seem to have very mixed results, though they 
match up pretty effectively with my understanding of human metabolism.&nbsp;
 Eating a diet more similar in contents to what you'd find in the 
ancestral environment seems like a good heuristic, if not a perfect 
one.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Changing habits around physical activity is probably one of the simplest
 lifestyle changes you can make with really established benefits.&nbsp; 
You'll think more clearly, write better code, feel healthier, and almost definitely live 
longer.&nbsp; Yes, it's hard.&nbsp; Do it anyway.&nbsp; You won't regret it.
