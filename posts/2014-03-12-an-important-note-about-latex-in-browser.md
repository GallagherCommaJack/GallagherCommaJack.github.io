title: An Important Note About LaTeX In The Browser
---

I'm going to be doing more and more mathy posts, and I want to be able to use LaTeX in them<br />
If you use Chrome, you're in luck - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-renderer/enfbnhdcmcipeoakalehejknkpbajodp">Tex Renderer</a> is an extension that will do exactly what you need it to.<br />
Another solution is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-the-world-for-chromiu/mbfninnbhfepghkkcgdnmfmhhbjmhggn/related">Tex</a> <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/181387">The</a> <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/92758">World</a><br />
<br />
On Firefox, on the other hand, there's a&nbsp;<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> <a href="http://www.gold-saucer.org/mathml/greasemonkey/">script</a>&nbsp;that works about as well as Tex Renderer<br />
<br />
If you don't know what LaTeX is, that's a whole different article - but a quick search brought up <a href="http://scottmcpeak.com/latex/whatislatex.html">this</a><br />
<br />
Some samples to test with:<br />
$\forall$<br />
$\frac{a}{b}$<br />
$\sqrt{2\pi}$<br />
$\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x}$<br />
<br />
