* What is this blog?
- I started this blog a couple years ago. Some friends had asked me to start writing about various different vaguely-lifehack-ish-things I'd been doing, so I made a thing where I could. Then I started doing some more math-heavy posts as part of my English class (long story). People liked those better, so that became the main content. Then I stopped blogging for a while. Now I'm maybe back.
